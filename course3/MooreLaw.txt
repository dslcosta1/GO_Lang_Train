Moore law holds that the density of transistors would double every two years, so we will have more powerful chips because smaller transistors switch faster. This was true until some years ago, but not anymore. We reach a power/temperature wall, Transistors consume power when they switch; increasing transistor density leads to an increase in power consumption. Consuming a lot of energy, the transistors generate a lot of thermodynamic energy, which leads to high temperatures, which can cause heat problems on the computer. The solution for that was to develop multicore chips.

One strategy that can be used to reduce the power consumed by transistors is to reduce the voltage. According to the Dennard scale, the voltage should decrease with the size of the transistor. However, due to physical limitations and noise issues, the voltage cannot be made too low. In addition, there is also a problem of power leakage, where the transistor consumes power even without a switch.
